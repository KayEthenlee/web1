  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="Javascript specification wrote by Wiki"> JavaScript</a> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[9] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, just-in-time compiled, multi-paradigm programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[10] JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[11] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[12] and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
